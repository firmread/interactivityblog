<p>Project: SDUB</p>
<p>สดับ, sdub (v.) (Thai) : to listen with intense concentration</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questioning cultural aspects of sonic and performative experience that affected by emerging computational approach to art, this project seeks to explore a position for a new aesthetic possibilities on this approach. By the given context of 21st century, where the line between the performer and the participant, apollonian experience in concert hall and dionysiac experience in urbanspace, and their relationship through a new media are blurred, the main question of this project is: can we achieve a new sublime.</p>
<p>After some research I found a interesting point on how the sound scholars have been discussing about the act of listening and the consciousness of the participant in performative moments and how it plays equal role in perceiving the performance as the act of the performer. Which also connected back to the influence of eastern philosophy of Zen that travelled to the west in the 50s. I think of this ability to concentrate on every sonic moment of our life is a very hard skill to gain, yet can be achieve. Through this project I proposing the system that would sharpen the consciousness of the participant/user.</p>
<p>Therefore, for this project, I aim to create a sound system that allows people to listen to the sound of their own body, the soundscape of the city, and the macro sound of the universe at the same time. Utilizing rhythm analysis, sound filtering, and location based data feed to reflect each of the aspects sonically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve got initial inspiration for this project from Bjork Biophilia Live and the album’s iPad app. Both the album and performance are obviously different from the older form of music in term of incorporating code as a medium for music expression.</p>
<p>In Biophillia album which released as an iOS app in 2011, has change the way we think about music in the form of album. In the past, while technology keep shifting the way we interact with music records change as the medium change. Once it was vinyl, then it is cassette tape, CD, MD, and eventually MP3. Yet, most of those mediums the only interaction we can do with it would be to play, to pause, to rewind and fast forward. The recorded sound is to be play as it is, in strict sequence of time as it was recorded. However, that seems to be changing when it comes to the time that we have computational processor power of mobile phone and tablet in our pockets. The relationship between recorded sound and the action of play can be redefine and explore much further. Which Biophillia seems to be just the first step toward this exploration.</p>
<p>The most interesting part of this shift in playing with recorded sound, in my opinion, is to give the audience control over music. The flow of time in musical experience that was dictated by performer in the recorded medium has finally been giving up.</p>
<p>This remind me of John Cage’s <em>4’33’’ </em>as it was also one of the most impact critique on musical performance that it has became a cultural ritual more than just listen to the sound itself. In <em>4’33’’</em>, four minutes and thirty-three seconds of silence, the performer sit in front of the piano, open the cover, then close, back and forth until that amount of time has passed. Cage allow the performer to give up all his control over all the sounds and hand it to the audience. While take place in traditional auditorium, insulated wall and moment of silence before the performance start create intense concentration to listen. Sonic experience of the audience expanded out of traditional musical sounds to the murmuring of the crowd. Which is what Cage intentionally want to create in this piece as he said “Let sounds be themselves.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, my another inspiration from Bjork, her Biophillia Live in Roseland Ballroom, still is a traditional performance where audience don’t have much control over it. Yet, it lead me to another question.</p>
<p>One of the performer on the stage is Max Weisel, this twenty years old nerdy guy is also a programmer behind some interactive songs on Bjork’s iPad app. He was performing on the stage with a huge slate which consisted of four iPad combine together. As the performance goes on, I found that I was so intrigued by the idea that he computationally wrote the instrument that he was playing by himself. There is no boundary between tool maker and player. Therefore, it might also appropriate to say that his instrument was not those iPads or other materials that just acting as interfaces but was his very own code literacy that actually generating the sound.</p>
<p>My experience on Bjork’s live and iPad app makes me think more about the intersection between sonic experience and emerging ubiquitousness of computation capable objects like mobile phone or tablet. Where the definition of recorded play and live play is starting to blur. One of my main goal for this project is to explore this new medium and redefine sonic play experience through this platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This also bring me back to the dialectic between Greek philosophers, Plato and Aristotle about where the sublime is. While Plato believe in apollonian beauty, that there is a perfect beauty in the ideal world and through art we try to recreate that perfect ideal. On the other hand, Aristotle believe in dionysiac beauty, there is no perfect form. Beauty depends on the context.</p>
<p>While in the older mediums, recorded sound that can be listen to over and over can easily be considered as apollonian and live music as dionysiac experience. In this situation that computational medium is blurring this obvious order: where would the new sublime situate?</p>
<p>As I think back to John Cage and his thought that was inspired by Zen philosophy. “Let sounds be themselves” might can also be interpret as that every sound has their own beauty but it’s only up to the audience that they would be able to find its beauty or not. Therefore, subliminal experience actually depends a lot on oneself’s consciousness.</p>
<p>By taking the approach to sublime through consciousness and situate it on the context of ubiquitous computing, I stumble upon another problem. As it is really harder and harder to focus in this context. Everyone has multiple screen interfaces to interact with and all of them need our attention: can we still focus on listening the sound of an environment at all? And if we can’t is that means we also losing our ability to find its beauty?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, I’m proposing a system that aim to help us to regain our sonic consciousness. Which generate the sound according to user’s personal data such as a sound of heart beat or footsteps layered with sound generated from other scales. Hence, the user can be acknowledge Which for this project, I’m also focusing on two other layers: the urbanscape and the universe.</p>

<li>Bjork’s album’s concept of the universe</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>system as learning device</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most interesting concept that I considering to integrate into the system come from the discussion in Design and Education class conducted by Karen Sideman. Which we was discussing about Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s <em>Creativity: Flow and the Phychology of Discovery and Invention. </em>The discussion was about sayanalyzing the teaching strategy and utilizing the idea of ‘flow’ into the process. It was that moment that we found one interesting strategy.</p>

<p>fig.1 the chart of flow that shows the relationship between challenge<br />
and skill, and domains psychological states in between.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, every learner always start with a low skill on whatever they want to learn. On achieving flow, it is important that we have to put the student into the state of anxiety. Therefore, they started to have an awareness on what they’re about to learn. However, it is also important to balance it with enough motivation in the process. Otherwise, too much anxiety can also cause frustration and might cause the student to give up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goal of this system is to create the experience that helps participant to sharpen their sonic consciousness and eventually, be able to achieve flow in soundscape sublimation.</p>
